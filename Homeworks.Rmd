### Week 3 Regular Expression Homework 1/29/2024
#1. 
Find expression:  \s{2,}

I found multiple spaces with this expression but still left the spaces between the words

Replace expression: ,

#2.
Find expression:  (\w+), (\w+), (.*)

Let's break down what this regex does:

(\w+), captures the last name in group 1
(\w+), captures the first name in group 2
(.*) captures everything after the second comma (the institution) in group 3
In the replacement pattern:

\2 puts the first name first
\1 puts the last name second
(\3) puts the institution in parentheses

Replace expression: \2 \1 (\3)

#3. 

Find expression:  (\d{4}.*?\.mp3)\s+

Let's break down the regex:

\d{4} matches exactly 4 digits
.*? matches any characters (non-greedy) until
\.mp3 matches the literal '.mp3'
\s+ matches one or more whitespace characters
The replacement \1\n puts each matched filename followed by a newline character

Replace expression: \1\n

#4.

Find expression:  (\d{4})\s+(.*?)\.mp3

Let's break down what this regex does:
(\d{4}) captures the 4-digit number in group 1
\s+ matches the space(s) after the number
(.*?) captures the title in group 2 (non-greedy match)
\.mp3 matches the file extension

In the replacement pattern:
\2 puts the title first
_ adds the underscore
\1 puts the 4-digit number after the underscore
.mp3 keeps the file extension

Replace expression: \1\n

#5.

Find expression:  ([A-Z])[a-z]+,([a-z]+),\d+\.?\d*,(\d+)

Let's break down what this regex does:
([A-Z]) captures just the first capital letter of the genus name
[a-z]+ matches the rest of the genus name but doesn't capture it
, matches the comma
([a-z]+) captures the species name
, matches the comma
\d+\.?\d* matches the decimal number (but doesn't capture it)
, matches the comma
(\d+) captures the final number

In the replacement pattern:
\1 puts the first letter of the genus
_ adds the underscore
\2 puts the species name
, keeps the comma
\3 puts the final number

Replace expression: \1_\2,\3

#6.

Find expression:  ([A-Z])[a-z]+,([a-z]{4})[a-z]*,\d+\.?\d*,(\d+)

Let's break down what this regex does:

([A-Z]) captures just the first capital letter of the genus name
[a-z]+ matches the rest of the genus name but doesn't capture it
, matches the comma
([a-z]{4}) captures exactly the first 4 letters of the species name
[a-z]* matches but doesn't capture any remaining letters of the species name
, matches the comma
\d+\.?\d* matches the decimal number (but doesn't capture it)
, matches the comma
(\d+) captures the final number

In the replacement pattern:

\1 puts the first letter of the genus
_ adds the underscore
\2 puts the first 4 letters of the species name
, keeps the comma
\3 puts the final number

This will transform your data into the exact format requested, with abbreviated genus and species names.

Replace expression: \1_\2,\3

#7.

Find expression:  ([A-Z][a-z]{2})[a-z]+,([a-z]{3})[a-z]*,(\d+\.\d+),(\d+)

Let's break down what this regex does:

Let's break down what this regex does:

([A-Z][a-z]{2}) captures the first 3 letters of the genus name
[a-z]+ matches but doesn't capture the rest of the genus name
, matches the comma
([a-z]{3}) captures the first 3 letters of the species name
[a-z]* matches but doesn't capture any remaining letters
, matches the comma
(\d+\.\d+) captures the decimal number
, matches the comma
(\d+) captures the final number

In the replacement pattern:

\1\2 concatenates the 3-letter genus and species abbreviations
, adds the first comma
\4 puts the final number second
, adds the second comma
\3 puts the decimal number last

Replace expression: \1\2,\4,\3

#8.
Changes made:
First, I want to clean up the pathogen_binary column. The inputs I am expecting to see in this column are 1 and 0s (because it is a binary column). However, there are NA's in the column. Therefore, I want to change these to 0s.
1. Find expression: NA (I also checked the case sensitive button within the find and replace tab in BBedit)
Replace expression: 0

I replaced all of the NAs with 0s. This find expression allowed me to not replace the "na" found in the column name.

Next, I want to clean up bombus_spp and host_plant columns. The bombus_spp includes the species name impatiens that is clearly misspelled throughout the column. In addition, host_plant column also contains special characters that are incorrect.
2. Find Expressions: [!@#$%^&*()_+-]
Replace expression: with nothing (leave blank)

These find and replaces clean up the column to just read impatiens and cleaned up this column. I skipped the header columns so I did not replace those underscores. 

Now I want to add an underscore to every word combo. 
3. Find Expressions: crown vetch
Replace expression: crown_vetch

Find Expressions: red clover
Replace expression: red_clover

Find Expressions: knot weed
Replace expression: knot_weed

I do not see anything visibly wrong with the bee_caste column. However, the term male may be changed to "drones" or another character. to do this:
4. Find Expressions: male
Replace expression: drone
