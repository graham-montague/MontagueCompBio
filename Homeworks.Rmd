### Week 3 Regular Expression Homework 1/29/2024
#1. 
Find expression:  \s{2,}

I found multiple spaces with this expression but still left the spaces between the words

Replace expression: ,

#2.
Find expression:  (\w+), (\w+), (.*)

Let's break down what this regex does:

(\w+), captures the last name in group 1
(\w+), captures the first name in group 2
(.*) captures everything after the second comma (the institution) in group 3
In the replacement pattern:

\2 puts the first name first
\1 puts the last name second
(\3) puts the institution in parentheses

Replace expression: \2 \1 (\3)

#3. 

Find expression:  (\d{4}.*?\.mp3)\s+

Let's break down the regex:

\d{4} matches exactly 4 digits
.*? matches any characters (non-greedy) until
\.mp3 matches the literal '.mp3'
\s+ matches one or more whitespace characters
The replacement \1\n puts each matched filename followed by a newline character

Replace expression: \1\n

#4.

Find expression:  (\d{4})\s+(.*?)\.mp3

Let's break down what this regex does:
(\d{4}) captures the 4-digit number in group 1
\s+ matches the space(s) after the number
(.*?) captures the title in group 2 (non-greedy match)
\.mp3 matches the file extension

In the replacement pattern:
\2 puts the title first
_ adds the underscore
\1 puts the 4-digit number after the underscore
.mp3 keeps the file extension

Replace expression: \1\n

#5.

Find expression:  ([A-Z])[a-z]+,([a-z]+),\d+\.?\d*,(\d+)

Let's break down what this regex does:
([A-Z]) captures just the first capital letter of the genus name
[a-z]+ matches the rest of the genus name but doesn't capture it
, matches the comma
([a-z]+) captures the species name
, matches the comma
\d+\.?\d* matches the decimal number (but doesn't capture it)
, matches the comma
(\d+) captures the final number

In the replacement pattern:
\1 puts the first letter of the genus
_ adds the underscore
\2 puts the species name
, keeps the comma
\3 puts the final number

Replace expression: \1_\2,\3

#6.

Find expression:  ([A-Z])[a-z]+,([a-z]{4})[a-z]*,\d+\.?\d*,(\d+)

Let's break down what this regex does:

([A-Z]) captures just the first capital letter of the genus name
[a-z]+ matches the rest of the genus name but doesn't capture it
, matches the comma
([a-z]{4}) captures exactly the first 4 letters of the species name
[a-z]* matches but doesn't capture any remaining letters of the species name
, matches the comma
\d+\.?\d* matches the decimal number (but doesn't capture it)
, matches the comma
(\d+) captures the final number

In the replacement pattern:

\1 puts the first letter of the genus
_ adds the underscore
\2 puts the first 4 letters of the species name
, keeps the comma
\3 puts the final number

This will transform your data into the exact format requested, with abbreviated genus and species names.

Replace expression: \1_\2,\3

#7.

Find expression:  ([A-Z][a-z]{2})[a-z]+,([a-z]{3})[a-z]*,(\d+\.\d+),(\d+)

Let's break down what this regex does:

Let's break down what this regex does:

([A-Z][a-z]{2}) captures the first 3 letters of the genus name
[a-z]+ matches but doesn't capture the rest of the genus name
, matches the comma
([a-z]{3}) captures the first 3 letters of the species name
[a-z]* matches but doesn't capture any remaining letters
, matches the comma
(\d+\.\d+) captures the decimal number
, matches the comma
(\d+) captures the final number

In the replacement pattern:

\1\2 concatenates the 3-letter genus and species abbreviations
, adds the first comma
\4 puts the final number second
, adds the second comma
\3 puts the decimal number last

Replace expression: \1\2,\4,\3
